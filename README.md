# Cortical microcircuit model (Potjans & Diesmann, 2014)

## Overview

This repository contains a detailed mathematical description and a reference implementation of the model of a cortical microcircuit proposed by [Potjans & Diesmann (2014)][^1]. 
The model describes the neuronal circuitry under ~1 mm$`^2`$ cortical surface. 
It comprises four cortical layers (L2/3, L4, L5, L6), each represented by a randomly connected network of excitatory and inhibitory point neurons. 
The network connectivity is derived from anatomical and electrophysiological data.
Connection probabilities between neurons in the network are highly specific and depend on the cell type (excitatory, inhibitory) and on the locations (cortical layers) of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons.
In contrast to this high specificity in the connectivity, all neurons in the network are identical and share the same dynamics and parameters, irrespective of their type and location.
Similarly, all synapses are described by an identical dynamics, and differ only in the synaptic weight and spike-transmission latencies.
Synaptic weights and spike transmission latencies are randomly drawn from distributions which depend only on the type of the presynaptic neuron (excitatory or inhibitory), but are otherwise identical for all neurons and connections (with one exception).
In addition to inputs from the local network, neurons receive external inputs representing thalamic afferents and cortico-cortical inputs from more distant cortical regions. 

The original purpose of this model was to understand the relationship between the connectivity and the spiking activity within local cortical circuits. 
Specifically, the model demonstrates that the observed cell-type and layer specificity of in-vivo firing rates is largely explained by the specificity in the number of connections between cortical subpopulations, and doesn't require a specificity in single neuron or synapse dynamics.

In recent years, the model became an established Computational Neuroscience benchmark for various soft- and hardware architectures ([van Albada et al., 2018][2]; [Jordan et al., 2018][3]; [Rhodes et al., 2020][4]; [Dasbach et al., 2021][5]; [Albers et al., 2022][6]; [Kurth et al., 2022][7]; [Heittmann et al., 2022][8]; [Pronold et al., 2022][9]; [Pronold et al., 2022][10]; [Golosio et al., 2023][11]; [Kauth et al., 2023][12]; [Schmidt et al., 2024][13]). 

A list of studies citing and/or using the microcircuit model is provided [here](publications.bib) (studies *using* the model are tagged by `uses_PD14 = {yes}`). Feel free to contact us in case publications are missing in this list.
